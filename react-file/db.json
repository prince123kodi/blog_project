In a subsequent interview to The Indian Express, when asked about his views on the documentary, Anil said, “The first sentence itself says very clearly that, and the BJP and I are entities that actually have a lot of strong differences of opinion on a lot of things. But when it comes to the country’s core interests, including national interests and sovereignty, I think we should keep partisan politics out of it because I personally feel that is playing with fire and which will have bad long-term ramifications. So I said the country’s sovereignty comes over everything else.",

Asked why instead of one, two rallies are being planned in Nagpur at such a short interval, Londhe said, “Rahul Gandhi’s rally is part of the nationwide rallies planned by the Congress against the Modi government’s policies, while from the MVA’s ‘Vajramooth’ rally, the three parties will unitedly highlight the state government’s failures.",
